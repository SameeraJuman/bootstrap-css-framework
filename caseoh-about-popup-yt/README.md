# CaseOh's Youtube 'About' page
When you click the ***about*** button under the description of any of CaseOh's youtube video, it takes you to a page. I replicated that page, specifically the popup/modal, using HTML and bootstrap. 
## Figma 
[Here](https://www.figma.com/design/HObNf1LWIXNi5s6jhx7e8P/CaseOh-about-popup?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=9vaZzMtrFyRnaHY6-0) is a copy of the orginal youtube 'About' page. 

## Image within project folder
There is also an image of the original in the `img` folder, which is within this project folder `caseoh-about-popup-yt`. The image filename is `aboutPage`.
